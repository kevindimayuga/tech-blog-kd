M14 - This repo is a CMS-style blog application where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well.

## Description

The challenge is an Job-seeking coding assessment or take-home assignment (no starter code is provided, we will build this web application by scratch). The goal is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. It will be built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. It will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM and the express-session npm package for authentication.

The motivation behind this project is to utilize the skills we learned in MVC (Model-View-Controller).
