# tech-blog-kd
This repo is for module fourteen's challenge assignment.

## Description

The challenge is an Job-seeking coding assessment or take-home assignment (no starter code is provided, we will build this web application by scratch). The goal is to build an interface that will allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. The interface created here is a 'content management system' (CMS). It will be a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.

The motivation behind this project is to create a command-line application from scratch. It will help me utilize the skills in Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.
